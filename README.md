## Creation of Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Generation of Pronunciation Lexicon for Indian Languages (PL-IL) in W3C 

##Description

Its a mass development tool to create comprehensive machine readable pronunciation lexicon for Indian languages. The lexicon file contains the orthography, corresponding pronunciations, parts-of-speech, morphosyntactic description, idiolectic variation of word pronunciation and meaning of lexical entries in a format based on requirements defined by the W3C Voice Browser Activity Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) 1.0. The current version of the Pronunciation Lexicon for Indian Languages Toolkit (PL-ILT) PLS contains approximately 2 million lexical entries for Bengali. Although in this paper we only describe language specific issues related to Bengali, PL-ILT has the ability to adapt different languages.
